#lazyDequeue.js
###A very lightweight plugin to lazy load images with a queue for jQuery or Zepto.js

This plugin is very useful and it boosts performance delaying loading of images in long web pages because images outside of viewport (visible part of web page) won't be loaded until the user scrolls to them.
I decided to make this fork because I also wanted to have a queue system that allows me to load imgages (dequeue) with a definite parallelism in the background
